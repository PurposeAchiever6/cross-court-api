  CrossCourt’s SEMs are the face of CrossCourt at each session. Part host, part DJ, and part
  coordinator, you represent CrossCourt at each session you manage. You bring the energy and
  hold it in each session. If you are charismatic, empowering, and hospitable, then you may be
  a perfect Session Experience Manager

  As a session official, you will have fun enforcing the CrossCourt rules and maintaining
  order on the court. This isn’t your average referee role. We encourage getting to know our
  players, hitting a dance move in between games, or adding some flare to a foul call. You are
  a leader on the CrossCourt team and will work side by side with the SEM to deliver a
  seamless and enjoyable in session experience, every time.
