          You will be responsible for either keeping the kit in your car if the gym does not have a
          storage room or going into the storage room before the session starts and bringing it out
          for set up.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          All kits must be neatly stored near center court in session and properly stored after
          session. This will require you to take the lock provided and secure the bag before stowing
          away properly. You will keep the laundry bag and jerseys with you at all times.

      <h3>Pre Session </h3>
      <h4>Set up/check-in </h4>
      <p>
        Setting up the Crosscourt kit should take no more than 5 minutes after you grab it from the
        storage closet or take out of your car.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the steps we recommend you take in setting up (as you host more sessions, you'll
        also figure out what works best for you. but please do not fix what isn't broken):
      </p>
      <p>
        THE SESSION OFFICIAL WILL CHECK PLAYERS IN FOR THE FIRST SESSION WHILE YOU SET UP, HOWEVER,
        YOU WILL CHECK PLAYERS IN BEFORE THE 2ND SESSION
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click start session on your SEM dashboard if the SO has not done so already </li>
        <li>
          Hand the 15 orange clamped jerseys to the SO or set aside until he/she arrives, then hand
          it to them
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the Crosscourt Kit from the storage area and wheel to the side of the court with
          space, and unlock it with code 404
        </li>
        <li>
          IMPORTANT: Take out the speaker and cord and plug-into closest outlet, then connect it to
          your phone via Bluetooth (Tailgater Plus) (p.s. don't start the music until the other
          group before you is off the court)
        </li>
        <li>
          Take out Crosscourt podium and assemble at center and half court on the sideline so the
          front is facing the court OPEN WHITE CONTAINER AND SET LID ASIDE NEATLY
        </li>
        <li>
          Take the banner out of the container and wrap around stand so that it is set up evenly and
          straight...remember that Crosscourt is a premium, high-end experience
        </li>
        <li>
          Take your clamp out of container and tightly fasten it the the back of the podium in the
          center
        </li>
        <li>
          Place dots from container next to the stand on the left hand side about 1 foot apart from
          each other with the numbers facing the court. KEEP ORGANIZED THROUGHOUT SESSION
        </li>
        <li>Put the scoreboard from container on the stand </li>
        <li>
          Now take the remaining 15 jerseys out of laundry bag and place on one side of podium clamp
          and rotate under the podium for 2nd session. SESSION OFFICIAL WILL HAND YOU JERSEYS
          (11-15) 2 MINUTES BEFORE SESSION. KEEP THOSE ON THE HOOK UNTIL THE STRAGGLERS ARRIVE. YOU
          HAND THEM ANY COLOR.
        </li>
        <li>Take the laundry bag with orange clamp inside and place under/inside the podium</li>
        <li>MAKE SURE SO IS READY. BLOW WHISTLE AND BEGIN 1ST SESSION </li>
        <li>First session wrap up to be discussed </li>
        <h4>
          <strong>BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND SESSION</strong>
        </h4>
        <li>
          The first five players to the gym receive black jerseys, then the second five receive
          white jerseys. The last five receive their jerseys once game one starts (this ensures a
          smooth start when the Session Official blows the whistle the only 10 players with jerseys
          will know they're on).
        </li>
        <li>
          ONCE FIRST SESSION ENDS AND 10 PLAYERS ARE CHECKED IN FOR SESSION 2, BEGIN SESSION 2
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>General Notes about check-in</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Things to say when players arrive:
          <ul>
            <li>"What's up!? Is this your first Crosscourt session?" </li>
            <li>"Yo, welcome back man!" </li>
            <li>"Thanks for coming back again, appreciate it!" </li>
            <li>"You'll start on the white/black team. We'll start in X mins." </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The most important part of set up/check-in is that you are attentive to the players
            arriving, and give them a warm welcome to Crosscourt. The players are paying for a
            high-end, premium fitness experience, so it's imperative that you provide them with
            top-notch service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to remember the players' names. The same players will come to your sessions over and
            over again. If you remember their names, then they&apos;ll feel like VIP.
          </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>General Notes about setup</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Never start the music until the people who have the court before us are off the court. We
          need to be excellent/respectful neighbors. If the group before is running overtime (even
          by one minute), then politely remind them that we are paying for an entire hour
        </li>
        <li>
          If players are being noisy or shooting basketballs on side hoops before our session
          starts, parents or people from the group before you may ask you to "control" the players.
          Be respectful of the group that's on before us, and politely ask players to keep it
          down/not shoot until we're up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your phone's on silent when running a Session. Your phone's connected to the
          Bluetooth so any messages you get will be heard over the speaker unless your phone's on
          silent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure the "Playback" feature on Spotify (under settings) is set for the max 12 secs,
          so that one song fades into the next
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>In Session Rules and Format </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The hour is made up of games to 5 minutes or 11 points by 2's and 3's, whichever comes
          first
        </li>
        <li>Winner stays on for a max of 3 in a row</li>
        <li>Make sure to blow your whistle when the game is over or time is up</li>
        <li>All fouls are taken out of bounds closest to foul</li>
        <li>All And 1's result in the ball back, taken out of bounds </li>
        <li>
          Keep track of fouls as each team is warranted 5 team fouls with everything >5 resulting in
          a 2 point foul shot
        </li>
        <li>All 1 and 1's are instead a single free throw that counts as 2 points</li>
        <li>
          All fouls under 10 seconds result in a 1 and 1 aka a free throw that counts as 2 points
        </li>
        <li>The clock only stops under 30 seconds if a game is close </li>
        <li>
          If a ball goes out of bounds near you or you see a foul that the SO doesn't catch, you
          must make the call yourself or override the SO call
        </li>
        <li>If a game is tied after 5 minutes, we tip off for a "next basket wins" scenario</li>
        <li>
          Announce how many minutes left in a session at the 2,1, and 30 second mark as well as a 10
          second countdown
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Take Down</h4>

        Congratulations on a Session well managed! Once the session ends, you'll want to take the
        custom Crosscourt laundry bag, and collect all the players' jerseys. Feel free to walk onto
        the court, and collect them as they come off the court while thanking them for coming out.
      </p>
