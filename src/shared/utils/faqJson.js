For example, if a member upgrades from a 10 USD per month membership to a 20 USD option, they're charged prorated amounts for the time spent on each option. Assuming the change occurred halfway through the billing period, the member is billed an additional 5 USD: -5 USD for unused time on the initial price, and 10 USD for the remaining time on the new price.",
