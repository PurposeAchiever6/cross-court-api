          Athletic shoes are required, and we also suggest bringing a ball, water, and towel. Weâ€™ll
          take care of the rest.

          Arriving early is recommended since the first 10 players to check in start the first game.

          When you arrive, your Session Experience Manager will check you in and hand you a jersey.
          Depending on the order of your arrival, your SEM will let you know which color jersey to
          wear.
        </p>

          In the meantime, talk strategy with your teammates, or stretch out until you hear the
          whistle.
