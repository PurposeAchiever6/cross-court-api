        GENERAL STATEMENT ON PRIVACY, PERSONAL DATA, AND COMMUNICATIONS
      </span>
      <br />
      If you use the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your

      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">USER PROVIDED INFORMATION</span>
      <br />
      Crosscourt does not collect any personal information about individuals -- such as names and
      postal codes, home addresses, and email addresses -- except when such information is knowingly
      provided to Crosscourt. Personal information might be obtained from online transactions such
      as session/membership purchases, retail purchases, and/or in-club session registrations.
      Additionally, personal information may be transmitted as part of a form submission or in
      connection with other activities or services made available on the Website. Any personal
      identification information retrieved by Crosscourt must be voluntarily submitted by the user.
      <br />
      <br />
      Crosscourt may use the information provided to contact you with important information,
      required notices, and marketing promotions.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">COVID-19</span>
      <br />
      Crosscourt clubs that currently operate a vaccine only policy for attendance may keep a record
      of your vaccine status. While we keep a record of vaccine status, we do not keep copies of any
      vaccine or other medical related records you may show to us as proof of vaccination.
      Crosscourt keeps such status records for internal purposes only and will not share the same
      with any third-parties. Should you wish your vaccine status to be deleted by Crosscourt you
      may make a request to Crosscourt at any time. Should you wish to then attend a subsequent
      session, you will be required to prove vaccination status again.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</span>
      <br />
      The Website collects some anonymous information about users automatically when individuals
      request pages through a browser. This information is used to keep track of the shopping cart
      and to help us monitor how individuals use the Website, which allows Crosscourt to provide an
      optimal experience and better service throughout the online offerings. The information
      collected automatically by the server does not contain anything that can identify individuals
      personally, such as an email or home address.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">SECURITY STATEMENT</span>
      <br />
      Crosscourt makes every effort to ensure that all of the transactions that occur on the Website
      are secure. All credit card numbers and transactions are encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
      We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide
      physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and
      maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and
      contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve the
      Website. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for
      information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security
      breaches.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">WHAT IS A SECURE CONNECTION?</span>
      <br />
      When a secure connection is established between your browser and a website or app, any data
      that is transferred over the connection will be encrypted to prevent it from being viewed by a
      third party. Encryption makes it very difficult for anyone to intercept or decode messages
      exchanged over this type of secure connection.
      <br />
      <br />
      Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari display an image of a locked padlock
      on their status bar when connected to a secure site. Google Chrome shows a green locked
      padlock on the far left side of the status bar when there is a secure SSL connection. Firefox
      colors the address bar yellow when connected to a secure site. Secure transactions are also
      indicated when the prefix in the location bar of your browser switches from http:// or
      https://. The additional 's' stands for "secure" and indicates a secure connection to the
      Crosscourt website. If you do not see this padlock, if it is unlocked, or if the protocol in
      the location bar is not listed as https://, then any data exchanged with the website is
      potentially visible to others.
      <br />
      <br />
      Depending on your browser, you may be able to view authentication information about a secure
      page by double-clicking on the padlock icon in the status bar. For more information on how
      your software establishes a secure connection, see the help files for your particular browser.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">COOKIES</span>
      <br />
      A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a website or app and stored on
      your computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot read data from your hard disk or read cookie files
      that were created by other sites -- the website or app that creates a cookie is the only one a
      browser will permit to access it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Like many other websites and applications, the Website uses cookies to obtain certain types of
      information. For example, Crosscourt might use cookies to control access to certain features
      such as your password and account, to customize content areas, or to analyze site activity and
      user behavior. Crosscourt reserves the right to use cookies in the future in conjunction with
      new content or expanded functionality.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are concerned about the use of cookies, you can explore your web browser's options to
      notify you whenever a cookie is set, or to disallow cookies altogether. You should be aware
      that prohibiting the use of cookies will significantly restrict access to certain types of
      content or features.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">HOW INFORMATION IS USED</span>
      <br />
      The following are examples of how Crosscourt might use the personal information collected
      through the Websites and App:
      <br />
      <br />
      - If you purchase a Crosscourt session or membership, sign up for a Crosscourt session, or
      purchase Crosscourt retail items, the required personal information (similar to that provided
      during a telephone or mail order purchase) will be used to complete your order.
      <br />
      <br />
      - If you indicate that you are interested in receiving Crosscourt related news and
      information, you may receive emails to the email address you provided as part of the
      registration process.
      <br />
      <br />
      For the non-personally identifiable information collected throughout the Website:
      <br />
      <br />- Aggregate data could be analyzed to describe the collective characteristics and
      behaviors of online visitors, and subsequently be used to further optimize the effectiveness
      of the website and app and the overall Crosscourt experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can help Crosscourt maintain the accuracy of your personal information by updating your
      account. Please update this information when you change your address, phone number, or email
      address. Crosscourt will never share telephone numbers, email addresses, or any personal data
      with third parties.
      <br />
      <br />
      Crosscourt reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content,
      or cancel orders, at its sole discretion
      <br />
      <br />
      <span className="inline-block py-2 font-bold">PRIVACY OF MINORS</span>
      <br />
      If you are under 18, you may use the Website only with the involvement of a parent or
      guardian. Crosscourt does not accept the registration of minors; please do not attempt to
      register on the Website if you are under the age of 18.
      <br />
      <br />
      A parent or guardian must sign a waiver on behalf of a minor before the minor shall be
      permitted to participate in a privater Crosscourt session. A minor must be at least 13 years
      of age and at least 5 feet tall to participate in an in-person session.
      <br />
      <br />
      If Crosscourt discovers that personal information has been submitted by a minor without a
      signed participant/registration waiver, Crosscourt reserves the right to delete such
      information. Crosscourt does not seek or share personal information from minors throughout the
      Website.
