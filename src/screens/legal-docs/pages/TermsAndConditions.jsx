        <br />
        Crosscourt hosts a one-hour, high intensity, team sport based fitness experience (

        participate in a session only if you had purchased and/or signed up for such session prior
        to the start time thereof. You may register for sessions through the Website by purchasing a
        Drop-in Credit, Membership or using your “First Session Free discount”. The First Session
        Free Discount is specific to a particular place, date and time (as indicated in the
        description of the session), after which the session will have expired. You are charged for
        a membership each month unless you cancel the membership. Once you purchase a membership and
        reserve a particular session using one of your purchases, the date, time and place of your
        scheduled Session is referred to herein as a <b>“Reservation”</b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Session and Membership prices are subject to change in our sole discretion. We accept
        MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express. Your credit card will be charged when you
        purchase a membership through the Website. Crosscourt will not process charges that use an
        incorrect, expired, or over-the-limit credit card. We will try to contact you if this
        occurs.

        your Reservation is cancelled, your purchased session will be returned to your account to be

        credit will have been used for the Reservation and will no longer be shown in your account.

        <br />
        <br />
        The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health
        Organization. COVID-19 is extremely contagious and is believed to spread mainly from
        person-to-person contact. As a result, federal, state, and local governments and federal and
        state health agencies recommend social distancing and have, in many locations, prohibited
        the congregation of groups of people. Crosscourt cannot guarantee that you will not become
        infected with COVID-19. Because the Facilities and Sessions are open for use by other
        individuals, you recognize that you are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.
        <br />
        <br />
        By participating in Sessions and attending Facilities, you acknowledge the contagious nature
        of COVID-19 and voluntarily assume the risk that you may be exposed to or infected by
        COVID-19 and that such exposure or infection may result in personal injury, illness,
        permanent disability, and death. You understand that the risk of becoming exposed to or
        infected by COVID-19 may result from the actions, omissions, or negligence of yourself and
        others, including, but not limited to, Crosscourt employees, representatives, contractors
        and agents.
        <br />
        <br />
        Crosscourt clubs that currently operate a vaccine only policy for attendance may keep a
        record of your vaccine status. While we keep a record of vaccine status, we do not keep
        copies of any vaccine or other medical related records you may show to us as proof of
        vaccination. Crosscourt keeps such status records for internal purposes only and will not
        share the same with any third-parties. Should you wish your vaccine status to be deleted by
        Crosscourt you may make a request to Crosscourt at any time. Should you wish to then attend
        a subsequent session, you will be required to prove vaccination status again.
        <br />
        <br />
        BY PARTICIPATING IN SESSIONS AND ATTENDING FACILITIES, YOU VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO ASSUME ALL
        OF THE FOREGOING RISKS AND ACCEPT SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INJURY TO YOURSELF (INCLUDING,
